    "This notebook walks you each step to train a model using containers from the NGC Catalog. We chose the GPU optimized Pytorch container as an example. The basics of working with docker containers apply to all NGC containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show you how to:\n",

    "* Install the Docker Engine on your system\n",
    "* Pull a Pytorch container from the NGC Catalog using Docker\n",
